*Embedded computing for Arduino SDK with GNU make*

![](./img/Logo-064-eC.png)

emCode is a set of tools to ease development for the most popular embedded computing boards. Those tools are designed to be used with the excellent Visual Studio Code IDE.

For convenience, emCode relies on the Arduino SDK, as it packs and manages the tool-chains, frameworks and utilities for a large range of boards.

emCode is the continuation of [embedXcode](https://embeddedcomputing.weebly.com/embedxcode.html), with two notable differences: emCode is no longer designed for Xcode but for Visual Studio Code; emCode no longer targets macOS but Linux and Windows with Windows Sub-system for Linux (WSL).

Happy development!
